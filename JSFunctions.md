**JS functions**

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

**Example**

function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}



**Decalaring a function**

When we declare a variable within a JavaScript function, it becomes LOCAL to the function.

**Calling a function**

With the call() method, you can write a method that can be used on different objects.
