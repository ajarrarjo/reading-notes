The `<img srcset="" src="" alt="">` syntax is for serving differently-sized versions of the same image. You could try to serve entirely different images using this syntax, but browsers assume that everything in a srcset is visually-identical and will choose whichever size they think is best, in impossible-for-you-to-predict ways. So I wouldnâ€™t reccomend it.

Rounded Image:

`img {
  border-radius: 8px;
}`

`Circled Image:

img {
  border-radius: 50%;
}`

* The CSS filter property adds visual effects (like blur and saturation) to an element.


* You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.

* X Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.

*  You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.

*  To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.
