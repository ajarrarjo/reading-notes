# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

***With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property. The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.***



## CSS Transitions

CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

 Mouse over the element below to see a CSS transition effect.

 To create a transition effect, you must specify two things: 
 * the CSS property you want to add an effect to 
 * the duration of the effect

 ## CSS Animations
CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash!

What are CSS Animations?
An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.

To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.

Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.
