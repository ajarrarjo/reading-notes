**Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM**

***Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming***


What is the hardest thing about writing code?
Below are the common answers accourding to John Sonmez:


* Learning a new technology
* Naming things
* Testing your code
* Debugging
* Fixing bugs
* Making software maintainable

 And for sure there are many other reason, John Sonmez believes that the single hardest thing about programming is learning the problem domain.

**familiarity**

Familiarity is a good knowledge of something, or the fact that you know it so well.
Getting Familiar with the things make them very simple functionality, easily explainable, but most importantly, easily understood.

***Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain***

**understanding the problem is the most critical piece to the equation. It is very difficult to solve a problem before you know the question.  It’s like buzzing in on Jeopardy before you hear the clue and shouting out random questions.**

 If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things: 

1. Make the problem domain easier
2. Get better at understanding the problem domain 

**Object Literals**

A JavaScript object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package. This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems when combining code.

 ***Object literals enable us to write code that supports lots of features yet still provide a relatively straightforward process for implementers of our code. No need to invoke constructors directly or maintain the correct order of arguments passed to functions.***

**Properties of document object**

All attributes are accessible by using the following methods:
* hasAttribute(name) – checks for existence.
* getAttribute(name) – gets the value.
* setAttribute(name, value) – sets the value.
* removeAttribute(name) – removes the attribute.

**TRAVERSING THE DOM**
