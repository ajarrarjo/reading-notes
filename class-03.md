**HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model**

![HTMLLISTS](http://ways2web.weebly.com/uploads/5/4/4/8/54485903/8033093_orig.png)

**Unordered list** — Used to create a list of related items, in no particular order.

**Ordered list** — Used to create a list of related items, in a specific order.

**Description list** — Used to create a list of terms and their descriptions.

**HTML Boxes**

![boxes](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/images/boxdim.png)

**Explanation of the different parts:**

**Content** - The content of the box, where text and images appear

**Padding** - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent

**Border** - A border that goes around the padding and content

**Margin** - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

**Example**

`div {
  width: 270px;
  border: 25px solid green;
  padding: 60px;
  margin: 15px;
}
`





**JAVASCRIPT**

***Sometimes you will want to use
a double or single quote mark
within a string.
Because strings can live in single
or double quotes, if you just
want to use double quotes in the
string, you could surround the
entire string in single quotes.
If you just want to use single
quotes in the string, you could
surround the string in double
quotes (as shown in the third line
of this code example).
You can also use a technique
called escaping the quotation
characters. This is done by
using a backwards slash (or
"backslash") before any type of
quote mark that appears within
a string (as shown on the fourth
line of this code sample).
The backwards slash tells the
interpreter that the following
character is part of the string,
rather than the end of it.***



**Also USING A VARIABLE TO
STORE A BOOLEAN**

***Boolean is a primitive data type in JavaScript. Boolean can have only two values, true or false. It is useful in controlling program flow using conditional statements like if..else, switch, while, do..while.***

Example:

`var YES = true;
var NO = false;

if(YES)
{
    alert("This code block will be executed");
}

if(NO)
{
    alert("This code block will not be executed");
}`


***JavaScript & jQuery***

Whenever you are not sure about a decsion you can use conditional statemts.
