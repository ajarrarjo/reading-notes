Hello Everyone,	
I am ***Abdullah Jarrar***, graduated from Zarqa University with a bachelor degree in translation. I have about nine years of experience in different fields, mostly in the field of E-Business and E-Commerce.
I worked for more than six years in Aspire with different teams; started as a customer support representative where I provided technical and informative support for US customers and I supported the QA team in release times, later worked as a senior data analyst with IBM & Tangoe where I provided support for seven fortune 500 customers.
After that I worked as an innovation coordinator and center manager with Relief International for almost 15 months. Ended as a product master with Amazon for 6 months. 
Since I spent most of my career in the field of IT, I was always into coding, but never had the chance to get to learn it, now that I got this opportunity I will be focused during the next 6 months to learn as much as I can as I believe this internship will open a lot of opportunities for me.
