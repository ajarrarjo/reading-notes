**Forms and JS Events**

Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred
to a printed document that contains
spaces for you to fill in information.
HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different
elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to
your site.

1. Step 1) Add HTML:
Use a <form> element to process the input. You can learn more about this in our PHP tutorial. Then add inputs (with a matching label) for each field.
Step 2) Add CSS.

The HTML <input> element is the most used form element.

An <input> element can be displayed in many ways, depending on the type attribute.
