***Some Important Notes on CSS Color:***

* X It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).

* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
