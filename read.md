|##***Growth Mindset***


**Growth mindset** is the believe that you can grow, it’s not about having a superpower not about being talented, it’s about the believe in yourself that you can learn, you can develop yourself, you can create and make difference. 

### ***Reminders to myself stay in growth mindset
:***
1.	**Challenge** yourself/ When you get afraid of something run toward that thing, face it, beat it.. I always beat my fears and I can do it over and over again.
2.	**Effort.** Yes it has at first but with some more effort you will do it!
3.	**Success of others:** sharing the happiness of others succeed  will lead you to your own succeed .


I’ll take the chance to let you know more about me.

You probably remember little about me, especially that I worked in many different positions. This could be a great adding value for myself or any institution but I am facing a challenge now that I am not very special in one thing. I know a little bit about a lot of things, I believe this is the time to get on the path that I always wanted; it’s time to learn and get deeper in software development.
